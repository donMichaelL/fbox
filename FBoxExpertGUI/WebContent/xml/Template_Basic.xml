	<!-- 
		A Fusion Application Script should necessarily contain the following sections:
			a. The "streamers" section where the fusion expert defines the sensor streams that are going to be taken into account
			b. The "contextors" section where the appropriate algorithms (SISO or MISO) and their inputs streams are listed
			c. The "output" section where the containers of the SFE's result (e.g. Email, CAP message etc.) are specified
	-->
	<output>
		<!--
			For each output container the following must be defined:
				a. The output stream (or streams) that is going to be published by this container.
			    b. The formatter that should be used to transform these data in the appropriate format.
			    c. The adapter that defines the transfer protocol (e.g. http, email etc.) for the formatter's outcome.
				
			The input stream (or streams) for such a container must come from the "contextors" section and not directly from the "streamers" section.
		-->
	</output>
	
	<streamers>
		<!--
			The sensor streams that are going to be used for the fusion scenario should be defined here.
			These streams can be selected by the following "filters":
				a. Unique ID (type=identity)
				b. Phenomenon URN (type=phenomenon) 
				c. Location (type=spatial)
			
			The latter case stands for the need of spatial selection of sensor streams in an area of interest.
		-->
	</streamers>
	
	<contextors>
		<!--
			The algorithms that are going to be used must be specified here.
			We can have SISO (singe input, single output) or MISO (multiple input, single output) algorithms.
			Each algorithm is encapsulated inside a "contextor" and in order to be defined correctly, the following are required:
				a. Algorithm's name
				b. Algorithm's parameters (should there are any)
				c. Algorithm's input stream (SISO) or streams (MISO)
				
			An input stream can be the output from another contextor or a streamer from the "streamers" section.
